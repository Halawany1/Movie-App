## Overview

Welcome to the Movie App repository! This Flutter application is built with a clean architecture, incorporating distinct layers for data, domain, and presentation. The architecture ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, fostering separation of concerns and scalability. Let's dive into the key features and architectural components of the Movie App.

## Features

- **clean architecture:**  incorporating distinct layers for data, domain, and presentation.
  
- **API Handling:** Utilizes Dio for seamless handling of API requests, supporting GET and POST operations to interact with TMDB API.

- **Authentication:** Implements user authentication functionalities such as login and signup with validation.

- **Professionally Shared Preferences:** Securely stores user data and preferences using shared preferences, ensuring a professional and reliable data storage solution.

- **Splash Screen Animation:** Engages users with an animated splash screen for a visually appealing start to the app.

- **Loading Animation:** Enhances user experience with loading animations during data retrieval or processing.

- **State Management (Cubit):** Adopts the Cubit pattern for efficient state management, ensuring a scalable and organized application architecture.

- **Google Fonts:** Integrates custom fonts using the `google_fonts` package for enhanced typographic design.

- **Gradients Color:** Enhances visual aesthetics with gradient colors for a modern and dynamic user interface.

- **TMDB API Integration:** Leverages TMDB API for fetching movie-related data, ensuring a rich and up-to-date content experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your development machine. For installation instructions, refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Movie_App.git
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd Movie_App.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
   flutter pub get

## Project Structure

- # Data Layer:

- **Repositories:** Interfaces for data sources (local and remote) are defined here.
- **Data Sources:** Implementations of data sources, such as API calls and local storage, reside in this layer.
- **Model:** Represents the properties of a movie and includes methods for converting to and from JSON, which is a common requirement when working with APIs.

- # Domain Layer:

- **Use Cases:** Business logic is encapsulated in use cases, acting as intermediaries between the presentation layer and data layer.
- **Entities:** Core business entities, representing the main data models of the application, are defined here.
- **Repositories:** Abstract repository interfaces, connecting the domain layer to the data layer, are specified here.

- # Presentation Layer:

- **Cubit:** The Cubit pattern is employed for state management, promoting a reactive and predictable application state.
- **Screens and Widgets:** The UI components, screens, and widgets are designed based on the state emitted by Cubits.


  
## Usage
